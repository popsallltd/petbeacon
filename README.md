# PetBeacon

**Guiding Pets Home** — A community-powered lost pet recovery network

## What is PetBeacon?

PetBeacon connects lost pets with their owners through:

- **Radius Alerts**: When a pet goes missing, nearby app users get push notifications
- **Sighting Reports**: Community members report sightings, building a movement timeline
- **Helper Network**: Volunteers with microchip scanners help verify found pets

## The Problem

Microchipped cats are returned only 38.5% of the time, dogs only 52.2%. The current system requires finders to travel to vets or shelters for scanning - a barrier that leaves nearly half of microchipped pets unreunited.

## The Solution

PetBeacon removes friction by bringing the community together. No hardware required, no subscriptions - just neighbours helping neighbours find their pets.
