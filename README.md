# PetBeacon

**Guiding Pets Home** — A community-powered lost pet recovery network

## The Problem

20 million UK pets are microchipped, yet only 52% of lost dogs and 38% of lost cats get returned. The chip works fine—the process doesn't. Finders have to take the pet to a vet during business hours to get it scanned. That's friction most people won't push through, so they post on Facebook, knock on a few doors, and move on with their day.

## The Solution

PetBeacon puts the microchip scanners owned by dog walkers, groomers, and volunteer helpers in local communities visible on a map. Register your pet once for £10, and if it's ever found and taken to a helper to get scanned, you get an instant notification with location and secure messaging. No public "lost pet" posts, no waiting for vets to open, no hoping the right person sees your flyer. Finder walks to nearest helper, chip gets scanned, you get pinged. Done.

For pets without chips or when scanning fails, users can still broadcast a Found or Lost Pet Alert—but the whole point is most reunions happen before it ever gets to that.

## How It Works

**For pet owners:** Register your pet and microchip number. If your pet ever goes missing and someone finds it, they use the app to locate a nearby helper with a scanner. The helper scans the chip, and you get an instant push notification with their location. Secure in-app messaging connects you directly. Reunion in hours, not days—without ever posting publicly that your pet was missing.

**For finders:** Open the app, see helpers near you on a map, walk the pet over, get it scanned. The owner is notified automatically. If no helper is available or the chip won't read, post a Found Pet Alert with a photo that goes out to nearby users.

**For helpers:** Already own a scanner? Register as a helper and appear on the map. Service providers (dog walkers, groomers, pet sitters) can list their business too—getting visibility to local pet owners while helping reunite lost pets.

## The Opportunity

That £10 registration? 100% goes to the owner's chosen local rescue centre. Users can still sign up for free and not pay the microchip registration fee. Our revenue comes from pet service providers (walkers, groomers, trainers etc) paying £20/month for visibility to a hyper-targeted local audience. Premium option at £40/month increases proximity catchment from 5 to 10 miles.

Year 3 projections: £175k profit, £150k to charity, 9 hours/week to maintain. Company has exit potential if played right—acquisition potential comes from large operators in pet insurance, GPS tracker companies, and vet chains.

We're not reinventing microchips—we're fixing the last mile, guiding pets home.
